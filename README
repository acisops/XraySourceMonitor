Version 0.2 Release Notes
Dec. 2021
--------------------------

Transferred repository ownership to ACIS Operations, in order to bring into compliant software control.

This release has several updated features:
     - Flags are in place to switch SIMBAD repositories in case the CfA mirror goes down (which has happened twice in 2021)
     - A new csv table is produced for FOT ingestion which includes very bright transients and any > Crab-bright active sources and is copied to an htdocs website
       	     (https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/acis/fot_brightsource_list/bright_sources.csv)
     - Several smaller updates including naming changes to the naming convention (static_xray.dat is now replaced with bright_xray.dat.)
     - Email alerts for very bright targets are now disseminated to HRC as well as ACIS.
     - Snapshots of the repository files are now copied at a slightly reduced cadence to save space over time.
     - LR software has already been updated to make use of the new naming convention.


Impact to ACIS of this release:
     - Essentially none.  These are largely invisible changes, which are mostly to expand reach to other groups (HRC, FOT).  


Outstanding Issues:
     - A circumstance can arise where the daily bright-source uses 1-day old MAXI data rather than the latest.  This is a minor issue in terms of H&S or impact but is under investigation.
